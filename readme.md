Facebook Gender&Age Tracker

Purpose of the app

The purpose of the app is to track and visualise the number of daily People Talking About This (PTAT) on a brand Facebook page by gender and age. PTAT is defined by Facebook as people who created a newsfeed story by liking, sharing a post or commenting on it. This metric is extremely important if you need to understand what kind of content works better for different audiences.

Facebook API provides a metric called “page_story_adds_by_age_gender_unique” which I intend to use for the app (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.8/insights).

Right now I download weekly reports directly from Facebook Insights and analyse it in excel. The app will make my life much easier and will give editorial teams a user-friendly way of monitoring this metric.

Features

When logged in users will be able to see the graph showing PTAT by gender/age for the past 7 days as a default option
